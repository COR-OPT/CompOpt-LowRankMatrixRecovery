# LinearConvergenceGD
Implementation of nonsmooth optimization algorithms for sharp and weakly convex problems.

Subgradient and prox-linear methods as well as methods for generating
synthetic instances of matrix sensing, robust PCA and matrix completion
instances are available under `src/CompOpt.jl`.

### Dependencies
The scripts depend on `ArgParse` and `PyPlot`. The core library has no external
dependencies.
